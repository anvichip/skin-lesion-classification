# Skin-Lesion-Classification
Trained on the MNIST: HAM100 Dataset. It has an accuracy of 98% on the training data and a validation accuracy of 96%. 
This is a Conv2D sequential model to classify the images into the 7 pigmented lesions:
1. Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec)
2. basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
3. benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl)
4. dermatofibroma (df)
5. melanoma (mel)
6. melanocytic nevi (nv)
7. vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc)
